## Common Directory

To build, run `make`

This is a directory of and code that my TSE sections share in common. Currently, `pagedir` only holds the pagesave function, which saves a page's html to a file (given name) in a given directory

`index` holds functions to load and save an index from and to files

`word` holds a function for normalizing (or lowercasing) a word
