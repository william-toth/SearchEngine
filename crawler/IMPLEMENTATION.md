## Implementation of Crawler

This implementation of crawler is very similar to that on the cs50 website (refer for implementation details), with a few key features.

It uses the `bag` and `hashtable` structures primarily, using the bag as a sort of stack to keep track of webpages that we need to visit and the hashtable as a means to check if a site has already been visited

We use a few helper functions and modules to fetch, save, and scan websites as well.
